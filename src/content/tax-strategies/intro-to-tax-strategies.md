## Overview

This is a demonstration article in a dynamically created section. Notice how this "Tax Strategies" section was automatically added to the navigation without any code changes!

## How Dynamic Content Works

The Altruist Alts Hub now automatically detects:
- New folders in the `src/content/` directory
- Markdown files within those folders
- Creates navigation sections and homepage cards automatically

## Adding New Content

To add a new section like this one:

1. Create a folder in `src/content/` (e.g., `tax-strategies`)
2. Add markdown files with frontmatter
3. The system automatically creates the section
4. No code changes needed!

## Benefits

This makes content management much easier:
- Content editors can add sections without developer help
- Consistent structure across all sections
- Automatic navigation generation
- Scalable content organization

## Next Steps

Create more articles in this folder to see them appear automatically in the "Tax Strategies" section of the sidebar and homepage.
