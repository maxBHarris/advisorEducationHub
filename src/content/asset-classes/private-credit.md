## PRIVATE CREDIT: INVESTOR EDUCATION TEAR SHEET

### What Private Credit Is and Why It Matters

Private credit involves lending directly to companies outside traditional bank channels. Instead of companies borrowing from banks or issuing bonds in public markets, they borrow from specialized credit funds that provide customized financing solutions.

The private credit market has grown dramatically since the 2008 financial crisis as banks retreated from certain lending activities due to regulatory changes. This created opportunity for non-bank lenders to fill the gap, providing capital to middle-market companies (typically $50M-$500M in revenue) that need flexible financing.

For investors, private credit offers attractive yields (typically 8-12%) with lower volatility than equities, floating rate structures that protect against rising interest rates, and seniority in the capital structure providing downside protection. Unlike bonds that trade daily, private credit loans are held to maturity, reducing mark-to-market volatility.

For advisors, private credit provides clients with higher income than traditional fixed income, floating rate exposure during rising rate environments, and diversification from public credit markets.

### Investment Structures and Vehicles

**Closed-End Credit Funds**

Traditional private credit funds operate as closed-end limited partnerships. Investors commit capital that's called as loan opportunities arise over a 3-5 year investment period. The fund deploys capital into loans, collects interest income and principal repayments, then distributes proceeds to investors over the fund's 7-10 year life.

These funds typically begin distributing income within 6-12 months as loans are originated and start generating interest payments.

**Interval Funds**

Registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, interval funds offer private credit exposure with limited liquidity. They provide quarterly or semi-annual redemption windows (typically 5-25% of fund assets) while holding portfolios of private loans.

Interval funds appeal to investors seeking higher yields than public credit with more liquidity than traditional private funds.

Business Development Companies (BDCs)

BDCs are publicly traded closed-end funds that invest in private credit. They trade on exchanges with daily liquidity, pay out 90% of income as dividends (required for tax benefits), and provide transparency through public filings.

BDCs offer easy access to private credit but trade at market prices that may disconnect from net asset value during volatility.

**Evergreen Funds**

Some managers offer perpetual structures without fixed end dates. These funds continuously raise capital, originate loans, and provide periodic redemption opportunities, combining aspects of closed-end and open-end structures.

Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs)

Larger investors ($10M+ minimums) may establish SMAs with credit managers, providing full transparency into underlying loans, customized portfolio construction, and direct ownership of loan assets.

### Credit Strategies and Lending Types

Private credit encompasses diverse lending strategies:

Direct Lending (Sponsored)

Loans to private equity-backed companies, typically for leveraged buyouts, acquisitions, or refinancings. Direct lending is the largest private credit segment, characterized by:

**Secured senior debt with first priority claims on assets**

Floating rates (typically SOFR + 5-8%)

**Loan-to-value ratios of 40-60%**

5-7 year maturities

**Financial maintenance covenants protecting lenders**

Direct lending to PE-backed companies benefits from sponsor support and operational improvements.

Direct Lending (Non-Sponsored)

Loans to founder-owned, family-owned, or independent companies without PE backing. These situations often involve:

**Business succession financing**

**Growth capital for expansion**

**Acquisition financing for strategic buyers**

**Recapitalizations**

Non-sponsored lending requires deeper underwriting given the absence of professional PE oversight but can offer higher yields.

**Unitranche**

A hybrid structure combining senior and subordinated debt in a single loan, simplifying capital structures. Unitranche loans typically price at SOFR + 6-9%, offering higher yields than senior loans with moderate additional risk.

**Mezzanine Debt**

Subordinated, unsecured loans ranking below senior debt but above equity. Mezzanine typically includes equity participation (warrants or equity co-investment) alongside 10-14% cash interest, targeting total returns of 12-18%.

Mezzanine suits companies needing growth capital without diluting equity ownership significantly.

Asset-Based Lending (ABL)

Loans secured by specific assets—inventory, accounts receivable, equipment, or real estate. ABL provides working capital flexibility for companies with valuable tangible assets, often at lower rates than cash flow-based lending due to hard asset collateral.

**Specialty Finance**

Niche lending strategies targeting specific sectors or situations:

**Real estate debt:** Construction loans, bridge financing, mezzanine for property developments

**Venture debt:** Loans to venture-backed technology companies supplementing equity funding

**Infrastructure debt:** Financing for infrastructure projects with stable cash flows

**Aviation/equipment finance:** Loans secured by aircraft, machinery, or equipment

**Consumer finance:** Portfolios of consumer loans (auto, personal, student)

**Distressed/Opportunistic Credit**

Loans to or purchases of debt from financially stressed companies. Distressed credit targets 15-20%+ returns through:

**Acquiring debt at discounts in bankruptcy or restructuring**

Providing rescue financing (debtor-in-possession loans)

**Loan-to-own strategies acquiring equity through foreclosure**

Distressed credit requires specialized workout expertise and higher risk tolerance.

### Due Diligence: What to Evaluate

**Manager Experience and Platform**

Private credit requires specialized origination and underwriting capabilities:

**Origination Channels:** Proprietary deal flow from PE relationships, intermediaries, or direct company relationships generates better terms than competitive auctions

**Underwriting Discipline:** Historical default rates, loss severity, and net loss experience demonstrate credit quality

**Portfolio Management:** Active monitoring, early problem identification, and workout capabilities

**Team Depth:** Experienced credit professionals with full economic cycles of experience

**Operational Infrastructure:** Legal, documentation, compliance, and servicing capabilities

**Credit Fundamentals and Underwriting**

Assess how managers evaluate borrower creditworthiness:

**Cash Flow Analysis:** Sustainable EBITDA, free cash flow generation, debt service coverage ratios

**Industry Dynamics:** Competitive positioning, barriers to entry, end-market exposure

**Management Quality:** Track record, industry expertise, succession planning

**Collateral Coverage:** Liquidation value of assets securing loans, advance rates

**Covenant Structures:** Financial maintenance covenants providing early warning signals

Strong managers pass on deals that don't meet strict credit criteria despite yield pressure.

**Portfolio Construction and Diversification**

Review how funds build portfolios:

**Diversification:** 50-100+ loans across industries, borrowers, and geographies

**Concentration Limits:** Maximum exposure per borrower (typically 3-5%)

**Industry Exposures:** Avoiding cyclical industry concentration

**Loan Size:** Lending to established companies versus smaller, riskier businesses

**Covenant Coverage:** Percentage of portfolio with maintenance covenants

**Historical Performance**

Evaluate track record across cycles:

**Gross vs. Net Returns:** Returns before and after fees and losses

**Default Rates:** Historical defaults relative to portfolio size

**Loss Given Default:** Recovery rates on defaulted loans

**Income Consistency:** Stability of quarterly distributions through market cycles

Quality managers show consistent income generation, low default rates (typically <2% annually), and strong recovery rates (60-80% of par).

### Fee Structures and Economics

Private credit fees vary by structure and strategy:

**Management Fees**

Most credit funds charge 1.0-1.5% annually on committed capital during the investment period, then on invested capital or NAV during the harvest period. This is lower than PE but higher than public credit given the active origination and monitoring required.

**Performance Fees**

Credit funds typically charge smaller performance fees than PE:

Hurdle rates of 6-8% (lower than PE's 8% given lower risk)

Carried interest of 10-15% (lower than PE's typical 20%)

Some funds use catch-up provisions allowing GPs to catch up to their full carry percentage after LPs receive the hurdle

**Fee Structures by Vehicle Type**

**Closed-End Funds:** Traditional management fees plus carry

**Interval Funds:** Management fees of 1.5-2.5% with performance fees of 10-15%

**BDCs:** Management fees of 1.5-2.0% plus incentive fees (typically 20% of income and gains above hurdle)

**Alignment Features**

Look for GP commitments of 2-5% of fund capital and clawback provisions ensuring managers don't over-earn carry if early profits are followed by later losses.

### Risk Factors and Considerations

**Credit Risk**

Borrowers may default due to business deterioration, industry headwinds, or macroeconomic stress. While private credit typically experiences lower default rates than high-yield bonds (1-3% annually vs. 3-5%), losses still occur.

Mitigate through:

**Diversification across 50+ borrowers**

**Conservative underwriting focused on cash flow coverage**

**Strong collateral coverage and covenant protections**

**Active portfolio monitoring and early problem identification**

**Interest Rate Risk**

Unlike fixed-rate bonds that decline in value when rates rise, most private credit uses floating rates (SOFR + spread). This protects against rising rates but exposes investors to lower yields if rates decline.

However, most loans have SOFR floors (typically 0-1%) preventing yields from falling below minimum levels.

**Illiquidity Risk**

Private credit investments typically lock up capital for 7-10 years in closed-end funds. While loans may mature in 5-7 years, the fund needs time to harvest all positions. Secondary markets exist but offer limited liquidity at uncertain pricing.

Only invest capital clients can commit long-term.

**Market Cycle Risk**

Private credit funds deployed during competitive lending markets (tight spreads, weak covenants, high leverage) may underperform if economic downturns occur. Vintage year matters significantly.

Favor managers with discipline to reduce deployment during frothy markets, accepting lower near-term yields to avoid problem loans.

**Refinancing Risk**

Borrowers may refinance loans early when credit markets improve, eliminating high-yielding loans from portfolios. Early payoffs reduce overall returns if proceeds cannot be reinvested at similar yields.

**Operational and Documentation Risk**

Private credit requires robust legal documentation, collateral perfection, and ongoing compliance. Poor documentation or monitoring can impair recovery in defaults.

### Tax Implications

Private credit taxation depends on fund structure:

Partnership Structure (K-1)

Traditional credit funds issue K-1 forms reporting:

Ordinary income from interest payments (taxed at ordinary rates, not qualified dividends)

**Capital gains/losses from loan sales or equity realizations**

**Possible state-source income requiring multi-state filings**

Interest income receives ordinary income treatment, resulting in higher tax rates than qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

BDC Structure (1099)

BDCs issue 1099-DIV forms reporting dividend income. While simpler than K-1s, BDC dividends are also taxed as ordinary income.

**Tax-Deferred Accounts**

Private credit works well in IRAs or other tax-deferred vehicles since ordinary income taxation can be deferred until withdrawal, and UBTI concerns are minimal for non-levered credit funds.

**Non-US Investors**

Non-US investors may face withholding taxes on interest income depending on treaty provisions and fund structures.

### Client Suitability Assessment

Private credit suits clients seeking:

**Enhanced Fixed Income Yields**

With government bonds yielding 3-5%, private credit's 8-12% yields appeal to income-focused investors willing to accept illiquidity.

**Floating Rate Exposure**

Clients concerned about rising interest rates benefit from private credit's floating rate structures that increase income as rates rise.

**Lower Volatility Than Equities**

Private credit offers equity-like returns with bond-like volatility, appealing to moderate-risk investors.

**Diversification from Public Markets**

Private credit exhibits low correlation to public equities and bonds, providing diversification benefits.

**Appropriate Liquidity Tolerance**

Clients must accept 5-10 year lockups in closed-end funds or limited redemption windows in interval funds/BDCs.

### Portfolio Construction Considerations

**Strategic Allocation**

Institutions typically allocate 5-15% to private credit. Individual investors might target 5-10% depending on income needs and fixed income allocation size.

Private credit can substitute for portions of traditional fixed income allocations, offering higher yields and floating rates while maintaining income focus.

**Strategy Diversification**

Blend strategies across the credit spectrum:

**Senior direct lending:** 50-60% (stable income, downside protection)

**Unitranche/mezzanine:** 20-30% (enhanced yields with moderate additional risk)

**Specialty finance:** 10-20% (diversification, niche opportunities)

**Opportunistic/distressed:** 5-10% (appreciation potential, higher risk)

**Vintage Year Diversification**

Commit to credit funds over multiple years to diversify entry points across credit cycles. Funds deployed during wide-spread markets (post-recession) often generate strong returns while tight-spread vintages may disappoint.

**Manager Diversification**

Spread commitments across 3-5 managers with different origination channels, industry focuses, and credit approaches to reduce manager-specific risk.

**Liquid vs. Illiquid Balance**

Combine closed-end credit funds with interval funds or BDCs to maintain some liquidity while capturing private credit premiums.

**Income Consistency:** Quarterly distribution stability

Quality credit funds deliver:

**Senior direct lending:** 8-11% net returns, <2% annual defaults

**Mezzanine:** 12-15% net returns, 2-4% annual defaults

**Consistent quarterly income with minimal principal impairment**

### Key Takeaways for Advisors

Private credit provides attractive, current income with floating rate exposure and lower volatility than equities. The asset class fills the gap between public bonds and private equity, offering bond-like predictability with enhanced yields.

Success requires selecting managers with disciplined underwriting, proprietary origination, and workout expertise. Understanding different credit strategies—senior lending for stability, mezzanine for yield enhancement, specialty finance for diversification—allows portfolio construction matching client objectives.

Private credit's combination of high current income, floating rate protection, and moderate risk makes it particularly valuable for income-focused clients in today's environment. For those with appropriate illiquidity tolerance, private credit deserves consideration as a core fixed income alternative.
