# REAL ESTATE: INVESTOR EDUCATION TEAR SHEET

## What Private Real Estate Investing Is and Why It Matters

Private real estate investing involves direct or indirect ownership of physical properties—office buildings, apartments, warehouses, retail centers, hotels—that generate income through rents and appreciate through market dynamics and property improvements.

Unlike publicly traded REITs that trade daily on exchanges, private real estate funds own properties directly, hold them for 5-10 years, and provide limited liquidity. This illiquidity allows managers to focus on long-term value creation rather than responding to daily market sentiment.

Real estate offers three potential return sources: rental income (current yield), property appreciation (capital gains), and value creation through improvements and repositioning. Total returns historically average 8-12% annually depending on strategy and market cycle timing.

For advisors, private real estate provides portfolio diversification, inflation hedging, current income, and tangible asset backing that clients can understand intuitively.

## Investment Structures and Vehicles

**Closed-End Funds (Commingled Funds)**

Most institutional real estate investing happens through closed-end funds. These funds raise capital over 12-24 months, deploy it into properties over 3-5 years, hold properties for value creation, then sell and distribute proceeds over the fund's 7-10 year life.

Investors commit capital upfront, though some funds call capital as properties are acquired. Unlike PE, real estate funds often begin distributing income from rental operations before the fund exits all properties.

**Open-End Funds (Core Funds)**

Open-end funds offer ongoing subscriptions and redemptions (typically quarterly) while maintaining portfolios of stabilized properties. These funds provide more liquidity but may impose redemption queues during market stress when property sales cannot keep pace with redemption requests.

Core funds typically target current income (4-6% yields) with modest appreciation, appealing to investors seeking real estate exposure with more flexibility.

**REITs (Public vs. Private)**

Public REITs trade on stock exchanges with daily liquidity but exhibit higher correlation to equity markets. Private REITs (non-traded REITs) own similar assets but don't trade publicly, offering real estate exposure without daily price volatility.

Private REITs typically allow redemptions quarterly or annually subject to limitations. They've grown popular for investors seeking real estate income without full illiquidity.

**Separate Accounts and Joint Ventures**

Larger investors may establish separate accounts with managers to purchase specific properties or portfolios, providing full transparency and control but requiring larger minimums (typically $10M+).

Joint ventures involve partnering directly with developers or operators on specific projects, offering higher potential returns but concentrating risk in single assets.

## Property Sectors and Strategies

Real estate encompasses diverse property types with different risk-return characteristics:

**Multifamily (Apartments)**

Residential rental properties ranging from garden-style complexes to high-rise urban towers. Multifamily benefits from:

- Strong, consistent demand—everyone needs housing
- Short lease terms (typically 12 months) allowing rent adjustments
- Demographic tailwinds from household formation
- Resilience during economic cycles

**Office**

Workspace for companies, from single-tenant suburban buildings to downtown towers. Office faces structural headwinds from remote work but quality properties in strong markets remain valuable. Key factors include:

- Location quality and access to talent pools
- Building class (A, B, C) and amenities
- Lease duration (often 5-10 years) providing income stability
- Tenant creditworthiness and industry diversification

**Industrial and Logistics**

Warehouses, distribution centers, and last-mile delivery facilities. E-commerce growth has driven exceptional industrial performance. Characteristics include:

- Long-term leases (5-10 years) with creditworthy tenants
- Lower capital expenditure requirements than office
- Supply constraints in key logistics markets
- Strong rental growth in infill locations

**Retail**

Shopping centers, malls, and street retail. Retail has undergone significant disruption from e-commerce but well-located, experiential retail (grocery-anchored, entertainment) remains resilient:

- Grocery-anchored centers provide necessity-based traffic
- Open-air lifestyle centers adapt to consumer preferences
- Single-tenant net lease (Walgreens, Starbucks) offers bond-like income
- Regional malls face structural challenges

**Hospitality**

Hotels and resorts generate revenue from nightly stays. Hospitality offers high operational leverage—income fluctuates significantly with economic cycles:

- Limited-service (Hampton Inn, Courtyard) versus full-service (Marriott, Hilton)
- Business versus leisure orientation
- Brand affiliation versus independent
- Higher risk-return profile than other property types

**Specialty Sectors**

Niche property types serving specific uses:

- **Self-storage**: Recession-resistant with low capital intensity
- **Healthcare**: Medical office buildings, senior housing, skilled nursing
- **Data centers**: Technology infrastructure with long-term tenant commitments
- **Life sciences**: Lab space for biotech and pharmaceutical research
- **Student housing**: Near universities with predictable enrollment

## Risk-Return Strategies

Real estate funds pursue different strategies along the risk-return spectrum:

**Core**

Stabilized, high-quality properties in strong markets with creditworthy tenants. Core strategies target 6-9% total returns through:

- Current income (4-6% yields)
- Modest appreciation (2-3% annually)
- Minimal leverage (0-40% loan-to-value)
- Low volatility

Core suits investors prioritizing current income and capital preservation.

**Core-Plus**

Properties requiring light value-add work or located in secondary markets. Core-plus targets 8-11% returns through:

- Property improvements (renovations, repositioning)
- Lease-up of vacant space
- Moderate leverage (40-60% LTV)
- Higher income and appreciation than core

**Value-Add**

Properties requiring significant improvements, repositioning, or lease-up. Value-add targets 11-15% returns through:

- Major renovations or redevelopment
- Operational improvements
- Leasing of significantly vacant buildings
- Moderate to high leverage (50-70% LTV)

Value-add involves higher risk but offers appreciation potential similar to private equity.

**Opportunistic**

Development, ground-up construction, or distressed properties. Opportunistic targets 15%+ returns through:

- New construction and development
- Significant repositioning or conversion
- Distressed or foreclosed properties
- High leverage (60-80% LTV)

Opportunistic strategies carry the highest risk with minimal current income during development or stabilization periods.

## Due Diligence: What to Evaluate

**Market Fundamentals**

Real estate is location-dependent. Assess macro and micro market factors:

- **Supply-Demand Dynamics**: Job growth, population trends, new construction pipeline
- **Economic Drivers**: Employment diversity, income levels, corporate headquarters
- **Barriers to Entry**: Land constraints, zoning restrictions limiting new supply
- **Submarket Quality**: Specific neighborhoods within metro areas vary significantly

Strong markets have diversified economies, population growth, and supply constraints.

**Property-Level Analysis**

Evaluate individual asset quality:

- **Physical Condition**: Building age, recent capital improvements, deferred maintenance
- **Location**: Accessibility, visibility, nearby amenities, competitive properties
- **Tenant Quality**: Credit ratings, industry health, lease expiration schedule
- **Occupancy and Lease Terms**: Current occupancy, lease duration, renewal probability
- **Operating Expenses**: Historical expense ratios, controllable vs. uncontrollable costs

**Manager Capabilities**

Real estate requires active management. Assess:

- **Acquisition Discipline**: Underwriting conservatism, ability to source off-market deals
- **Asset Management**: Leasing expertise, tenant relationships, property operations
- **Value Creation Track Record**: Successful renovations, repositionings, developments
- **Local Market Presence**: On-the-ground teams in target markets
- **Disposition Timing**: Historical ability to sell properties at optimal times

**Financial Analysis**

Review deal-level economics:

- **Purchase Price**: Valuation relative to replacement cost and comparable sales
- **Going-In Cap Rate**: Net operating income divided by purchase price
- **Pro Forma Returns**: Projected cash flows and exit assumptions
- **Leverage Terms**: Loan amount, interest rate, maturity, recourse vs. non-recourse
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: How returns change with varying rent growth, exit cap rates, holding periods

## Fee Structures and Economics

Real estate fee structures vary by vehicle type:

**Fund Management Fees**

Closed-end funds typically charge 1.0-1.5% annually on committed capital or invested capital, depending on fund stage. Open-end funds may charge fees on NAV.

Some funds calculate fees on gross asset value (property values) while others use net equity (after debt), creating different effective fee rates.

**Performance Fees (Promote)**

Real estate funds typically structure promotes as:

- Carried interest: 10-20% of profits above an 8% preferred return
- Promotes may be deal-by-deal or fund-level (better for LPs)
- Some funds use tiered promotes—higher carry percentages at higher return levels

**Property-Level Fees**

Managers may charge:

- Acquisition fees: 0.5-1.5% of purchase price
- Asset management fees: 0.5-1.0% of property revenue
- Disposition fees: 0.5-1.5% of sale price
- Construction management fees: 3-5% of construction costs

Quality managers often waive or offset property-level fees against fund management fees.

**Fee Alignment**

Look for GP commitments of 2-5% of fund equity, ensuring managers invest personal capital. Clawback provisions allow recovery of excess promotes if later investments underperform.

## Risk Factors and Considerations

**Market Cycle Risk**

Real estate is cyclical. Buying at peak valuations during low cap rate environments can result in disappointing returns if exit cap rates expand. Vintage year matters significantly.

Mitigate through:

- Disciplined underwriting with conservative exit assumptions
- Focus on income generation rather than appreciation
- Vintage year diversification across multiple fund commitments

**Leverage Risk**

Most real estate investments use 40-70% debt financing. Leverage amplifies both gains and losses. Floating rate debt exposes properties to interest rate risk if rates rise and properties cannot pass through costs via rent increases.

Assess:

- Loan-to-value ratios and debt service coverage
- Fixed vs. floating rate debt
- Loan maturity dates relative to expected hold periods
- Recourse vs. non-recourse structures

**Tenant and Lease Risk**

Properties depend on tenants paying rent. Tenant bankruptcies, non-renewals, or downsizing reduce income and require costly re-leasing efforts.

Evaluate:

- Tenant credit quality and financial health
- Lease expiration concentration
- Market rental rates versus in-place rents
- Re-leasing costs (tenant improvements, leasing commissions)

**Liquidity Risk**

Private real estate is illiquid. Funds have fixed lives or limited redemption windows. Property sales take months and may require discounts in distressed markets.

Only invest capital clients can commit for 5-10 years.

**Regulatory and Zoning Risk**

Properties operate under local regulations. Zoning changes, rent control (for multifamily), environmental requirements, or property tax reassessments can impact economics.

**Geographic Concentration**

Some funds concentrate in single metros or regions. While this allows deep local expertise, it increases exposure to market-specific risks. Diversified funds spread investments across 15-30 markets.

## Tax Implications

Real estate offers attractive tax characteristics:

**Depreciation Benefits**

Buildings generate annual depreciation deductions (typically over 27.5-39 years), sheltering cash distributions from current taxation. Investors may receive distributions exceeding reported taxable income.

**Cost Segregation**

Managers may use cost segregation studies to accelerate depreciation on property components, increasing near-term deductions and deferring taxes.

**1031 Exchanges**

At the fund level, some managers use 1031 exchanges to sell properties and reinvest proceeds into new properties without triggering capital gains, deferring taxes.

**Depreciation Recapture**

Upon sale, depreciation claimed is recaptured as ordinary income (up to 25%) rather than capital gains. Remaining gains receive capital gains treatment.

**Opportunity Zones**

Investments in Qualified Opportunity Zones can defer and potentially eliminate capital gains taxes on appreciated positions reinvested into these designated low-income areas.

**K-1 Reporting**

Real estate partnerships issue K-1 forms showing income, deductions, and gains. K-1s may include multi-state source income, requiring filing in multiple jurisdictions.

## Client Suitability Assessment

Real estate suits clients seeking:

**Current Income**

Real estate typically distributes 3-6% annual yields from rental income, appealing to income-focused investors, especially in low-interest-rate environments.

**Inflation Protection**

Property values and rents tend to rise with inflation. Multifamily with short leases adjusts rents annually. Other property types incorporate rent escalators.

**Diversification**

Real estate exhibits low correlation to stocks and bonds, providing diversification benefits in balanced portfolios.

**Tangible Asset Exposure**

Some clients appreciate real estate's physical nature and ability to understand value creation through property improvements.

**Moderate Liquidity Tolerance**

Unlike PE's 10-year lockups, real estate funds often begin distributing income within 1-2 years and fully liquidate within 7-10 years. Open-end funds offer even more liquidity.

## Portfolio Construction Considerations

**Strategic Allocation**

Institutional investors typically allocate 5-15% to private real estate. Individual investors might target 5-10% depending on income needs and liquidity constraints.

Real estate complements both equities (appreciation potential) and bonds (income generation) while providing inflation protection.

**Strategy Diversification**

Blend strategies across the risk spectrum:

- Core for stable income (50-60% of allocation)
- Core-plus and value-add for enhanced returns (30-40%)
- Opportunistic sparingly for appreciation potential (10-20%)

Match strategy mix to risk tolerance.

**Property Type Diversification**

Spread across property sectors:

- Multifamily: 25-35% (stable demand, demographic tailwinds)
- Industrial: 20-30% (e-commerce growth, supply constraints)
- Office: 10-20% (higher risk but potential value in quality assets)
- Retail: 5-15% (selective exposure to grocery-anchored, necessity-based)
- Specialty: 10-20% (self-storage, healthcare, data centers)

**Geographic Diversification**

Invest across multiple metros to reduce market-specific risk. Blend:

- Gateway markets (NYC, SF, LA) for stability and liquidity
- Sunbelt growth markets (Austin, Nashville, Phoenix) for appreciation
- Secondary markets for value and yields

**Vintage Year Diversification**

Commit to new real estate funds over multiple years to diversify entry points across market cycles, avoiding concentrated exposure to peak valuations.

## Key Takeaways for Advisors

Private real estate provides portfolio diversification, current income, and inflation protection through ownership of tangible assets generating cash flow from rents.

Success requires matching investment strategies to client objectives—core for income and stability, value-add and opportunistic for appreciation. Understanding property sectors, market dynamics, and manager capabilities drives investment selection.

Real estate's combination of bond-like income and equity-like appreciation, enhanced by favorable tax treatment, makes it a core alternative asset class for diversified portfolios. For clients with appropriate time horizons and income needs, private real estate deserves meaningful portfolio allocations.
