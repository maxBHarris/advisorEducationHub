# PRIVATE EQUITY: INVESTOR EDUCATION TEAR SHEET

## What Private Equity Is and Why It Matters

Private equity involves investing in companies that aren't publicly traded. PE firms raise capital from investors, use that capital to acquire companies, work to improve those businesses over 3-7 years, then sell them for a profit.

Unlike public stocks where you buy shares on an exchange, PE investments happen through funds. You commit capital to a fund managed by a General Partner (GP), who identifies companies to buy, manages those investments, and eventually exits them. Your returns depend on how well the GP executes this strategy.

PE has historically outperformed public markets over the long term, though with significantly less liquidity. The asset class works because PE firms can take a longer-term view than public company executives focused on quarterly earnings, implement operational improvements without public market scrutiny, and use leverage strategically to enhance returns.

For advisors, PE represents a way to give clients access to a broader universe of companies and potentially higher returns in exchange for illiquidity and higher minimums.

## Investment Structures and Vehicles

**Traditional Closed-End Funds**

Most PE investments happen through closed-end limited partnerships. Here's how they work:

The GP raises a target amount (say, $500 million) over 12-18 months. Once the fundraising period closes, no new investors can enter. The fund has a fixed life, typically 10-12 years with possible extensions.

You don't invest your full commitment upfront. Instead, you commit capital and the GP "calls" it over time as investment opportunities arise. If you commit $100,000, you might contribute $25,000 in year one, $30,000 in year two, and so on. These capital calls typically occur with 10-14 days' notice.

The GP uses committed capital to acquire companies, improve operations, and eventually sell those businesses. As exits occur, the fund distributes proceeds to investors. Your returns come from these distributions, not from selling your fund position.

**Evergreen Funds**

Some PE firms now offer evergreen structures without fixed end dates. These funds continuously raise capital, make investments, and provide periodic liquidity windows for investors who want to exit. They solve the traditional PE challenge of having capital locked up for a decade, but may trade some return potential for that flexibility.

**Interval Funds**

Registered as 1940 Act funds, interval funds offer PE exposure with quarterly or semi-annual redemption windows. These provide more liquidity than traditional PE funds but limit redemptions to a percentage of fund assets (typically 5-25% quarterly).

**Fund of Funds**

These vehicles invest in multiple PE funds rather than directly in companies. They provide instant diversification across managers, strategies, and vintage years, but add an additional layer of fees.

## Investment Strategies and Focus Areas

PE firms typically specialize in specific strategies:

**Buyouts**: Acquiring controlling stakes in established companies, often using leverage. Buyout funds focus on operational improvements, strategic repositioning, and multiple expansion. This is the largest segment of PE by capital deployed.

**Growth Equity**: Minority investments in mature companies seeking capital for expansion. Less leverage than buyouts, focusing on companies with proven business models ready to scale.

**Venture Capital**: Early-stage investments in high-growth potential startups. Higher risk and failure rates, but potentially outsized returns from successful companies.

**Distressed/Special Situations**: Investing in companies facing financial or operational challenges. Requires specialized expertise in turnarounds and restructuring.

**Sector-Focused**: Some funds concentrate on specific industries (healthcare, technology, industrials) where they've built deep expertise and networks.

Understanding a fund's strategy helps you assess whether it aligns with your clients' risk tolerance and return objectives.

## Due Diligence: What to Evaluate

**Track Record and Performance**

Review the GP's historical returns across multiple fund vintages. Look at:

- Net IRR (Internal Rate of Return) after all fees
- TVPI (Total Value to Paid-In) showing total value created relative to capital invested
- DPI (Distributions to Paid-In) showing actual cash returned vs. unrealized gains
- Performance relative to benchmarks and peers
- Consistency across economic cycles

Be cautious of funds with limited track records or those showing only unrealized gains without distributions.

**Team Experience and Stability**

The investment team drives performance. Evaluate:

- Years of experience in PE and relevant industries
- Team stability and turnover rates
- Deal sourcing capabilities and networks
- Operational expertise for value creation
- Alignment through GP commitment (how much the team invests personally)

Strong teams have continuity, complementary skills, and skin in the game.

**Investment Process**

Understand how the GP sources, evaluates, and manages investments:

- Deal flow sources and competitive advantages
- Due diligence rigor and specialist resources
- Value creation playbooks and operational support
- Portfolio monitoring and reporting
- Exit strategy development

Disciplined, repeatable processes produce more consistent results than one-off successes.

**Fee Structure**

PE funds typically charge:

- Management fees: 1.5-2% annually on committed or invested capital
- Carried interest (carry): 20% of profits above a hurdle rate (often 8%)
- Transaction and monitoring fees from portfolio companies

These fees compound over time. A fund with strong gross returns but excessive fees may underperform on a net basis.

**Fund Terms**

Review key terms in the Limited Partnership Agreement:

- Fund size and minimum investment
- Investment period (typically 4-6 years)
- Fund life (typically 10-12 years)
- GP commitment requirement
- Key person provisions
- Clawback provisions protecting LPs

## Fee Structures and Economics

Understanding PE economics helps you evaluate whether returns justify the costs.

**The 2/20 Model**

Traditional PE charges 2% management fees annually and 20% carried interest on profits. Here's what that means:

On a $100,000 commitment, you might pay $2,000 annually in management fees during the investment period. If the fund generates $200,000 in gains, the GP takes 20% ($40,000) as carry, leaving you with $160,000 in gains.

Many funds now have tiered fee structures—lower management fees after the investment period ends, or fees that decline as capital is returned.

**Hurdle Rates**

Most funds include a preferred return or hurdle rate—LPs receive all returns up to this threshold (often 8%) before the GP receives any carry. This aligns interests by ensuring GPs only participate in gains after delivering minimum returns.

**Fee Offsets**

GPs often charge portfolio companies transaction fees, monitoring fees, or directors' fees. Quality funds offset 50-100% of these fees against management fees owed by LPs. Without offsets, you're effectively paying double fees.

## Risk Factors and Considerations

**Illiquidity**

PE investments typically lock up capital for 7-12 years. You cannot access your capital during this period except through secondary markets (often at discounts). Only invest capital your clients won't need for a decade or more.

**Capital Call Risk**

When the GP calls capital, you must fund within 10-14 days. Failure to fund can result in penalties or forfeiture of interests. Ensure clients maintain liquidity reserves to meet unfunded commitments.

**Market Risk**

PE values fluctuate with market conditions. Entry timing matters—funds investing at market peaks may generate lower returns. Vintage year diversification helps mitigate this risk.

**Operational Risk**

PE returns depend on the GP's ability to improve portfolio companies. Poor operational execution, failed add-on acquisitions, or strategic missteps can destroy value.

**Leverage Risk**

Most buyout funds use 50-70% debt in acquisitions. While leverage amplifies returns in good times, it increases downside risk during recessions or rising interest rate environments.

**Concentration Risk**

A single failed investment can significantly impact fund returns, especially in smaller funds with 10-15 companies. Larger funds with 30+ investments provide more diversification.

## Tax Implications

PE funds structured as partnerships have specific tax considerations:

**K-1 Forms**

You'll receive Schedule K-1s annually, reporting your share of fund income, gains, and deductions. K-1s typically arrive in March or April, potentially delaying tax filing.

**Pass-Through Taxation**

Income and gains flow through to your tax return annually, even if you haven't received distributions. You may owe taxes before receiving cash.

**Unrelated Business Taxable Income (UBTI)**

If the fund uses leverage, tax-exempt entities (IRAs, foundations) may face UBTI, creating unexpected tax obligations.

**Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS)**

Some PE investments may qualify for QSBS treatment, potentially excluding up to 100% of gains from federal taxes. This is more common in growth equity and venture capital.

**Long-Term Capital Gains**

Most PE gains receive favorable long-term capital gains treatment since holding periods typically exceed one year.

Work with tax advisors familiar with partnership taxation to properly plan for these implications.

## Client Suitability Assessment

Not every client is appropriate for PE investments. Consider:

**Accredited or Qualified Status**

Most PE funds require investors to be accredited investors (income >$200K or net worth >$1M excluding primary residence) or qualified purchasers (investments >$5M).

**Liquidity Needs**

Clients must have sufficient liquid assets to meet unfunded commitments and maintain emergency reserves. A common guideline: PE should represent no more than 10-20% of liquid net worth.

**Time Horizon**

Clients need 10+ year time horizons. Those approaching retirement or needing capital soon are poor candidates.

**Risk Tolerance**

PE involves company-specific risk, leverage risk, and illiquidity. Clients must be comfortable with volatility and potential loss of capital.

**Sophistication**

Clients should understand the commitment structure, J-curve effect (early negative returns as fees are paid before gains materialize), and the importance of vintage year diversification.

## Portfolio Construction Considerations

**Allocation Sizing**

Institutional investors typically allocate 10-30% to PE. Individual investors might target 5-15% depending on liquidity needs and risk tolerance. Start smaller and build over time.

**Diversification Strategy**

Spread commitments across:

- Multiple vintage years (commit to 2-3 funds annually rather than concentrating in one year)
- Different strategies (buyout, growth, venture)
- Various sectors and geographies
- Different manager sizes and styles

This diversification smooths the J-curve and reduces manager-specific risk.

**Pacing Strategy**

Rather than committing all at once, develop a multi-year pacing plan. Commit to new funds consistently over 3-5 years to diversify vintage years and avoid market timing risk.

**Rebalancing Challenges**

PE positions can't be easily rebalanced like public stocks. As distributions occur, develop plans for reinvesting proceeds to maintain target allocations.

## Performance Benchmarking

**Relevant Benchmarks**

Common PE benchmarks include:

- Cambridge Associates Private Equity Index
- Burgiss Private iQ Indices
- State Street Private Equity Index
- Public market equivalents (PME) comparing PE to S&P 500 returns

Compare funds to appropriate benchmarks based on strategy and vintage year.

**Key Metrics**

- **IRR**: Time-weighted return accounting for timing of cash flows
- **TVPI**: Total value (distributed + NAV) divided by paid-in capital
- **DPI**: Distributions divided by paid-in capital (measures actual cash returned)
- **RVPI**: Residual value (unrealized NAV) divided by paid-in capital

Strong funds show top-quartile performance across multiple vintages, consistent DPI generation, and TVPI exceeding 2.0x.

## Key Takeaways for Advisors

Private equity offers clients access to a broader investment universe and potentially superior long-term returns. Success requires careful GP selection, proper portfolio construction, and clients who understand the commitment structure and illiquidity.

Start with proven, established managers with strong track records. Build diversified PE portfolios over multiple years. Ensure clients have the financial capacity and temperament for long-term illiquid investments. When implemented thoughtfully, PE can meaningfully enhance portfolio returns and provide access to attractive companies unavailable in public markets.
