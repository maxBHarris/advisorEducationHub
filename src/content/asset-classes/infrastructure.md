## INFRASTRUCTURE: INVESTOR EDUCATION TEAR SHEET

### What Infrastructure Investing Is and Why It Matters

Infrastructure investments involve ownership stakes in essential physical assets and systems that societies depend on daily—power plants, toll roads, airports, water systems, telecommunications networks, and energy pipelines.

These aren't speculative growth investments. Infrastructure assets generate predictable cash flows from long-term contracts or regulated revenue streams. A toll road collects fees from drivers. A power plant sells electricity under 20-year contracts. A cell tower leases space to wireless carriers on multi-year agreements.

**For investors, infrastructure offers three primary benefits:** steady income streams, inflation protection (many contracts include inflation escalators), and low correlation to traditional stocks and bonds. During market volatility, infrastructure assets continue operating and generating cash flow.

For advisors, infrastructure provides portfolio diversification and income generation for clients seeking alternatives to bonds in a low-yield environment.

### Investment Structures and Vehicles

**Closed-End Infrastructure Funds**

Similar to private equity, most infrastructure funds operate as closed-end limited partnerships. Investors commit capital that's called over 4-6 years as assets are acquired. Fund lives typically span 10-15 years.

These funds acquire multiple infrastructure assets, manage them for income and value appreciation, then exit through sales to other infrastructure investors or strategic buyers.

**Open-End/Perpetual Funds**

Some managers offer open-end funds with periodic subscription and redemption windows (quarterly or annually). These funds hold diversified portfolios of mature infrastructure assets and provide more liquidity than closed-end structures, though with limitations on redemption amounts.

**Listed Infrastructure Funds**

Publicly traded infrastructure funds invest in infrastructure companies and assets while offering daily liquidity. They provide easier access but trade at market prices that may disconnect from underlying asset values during volatility.

**Direct/Co-Investment Opportunities**

Larger investors may access direct ownership stakes in specific infrastructure projects alongside fund sponsors, reducing fees but requiring larger capital commitments and concentration risk.

### Infrastructure Sectors and Asset Types

Infrastructure investments span multiple sectors with different risk-return profiles:

**Transportation**

**Toll roads and bridges:** Revenue from usage fees, often with inflation-linked toll increases

**Airports:** Landing fees, terminal leases, parking, and retail concessions

**Ports and marine terminals:** Cargo handling fees tied to trade volumes

**Rail infrastructure:** Track ownership, freight terminals, passenger rail systems

Transportation assets typically have long useful lives (50+ years) and stable demand driven by economic activity.

**Utilities and Energy**

**Electric transmission and distribution:** Regulated utilities with stable rate structures

**Natural gas pipelines and storage:** Transportation fees under long-term contracts

**Water and wastewater systems:** Essential services with municipal contracts

**Renewable energy:** Solar and wind farms with power purchase agreements

Utility assets offer highly predictable cash flows under regulatory frameworks or long-term contracts.

**Communications**

**Cell towers:** Lease revenue from wireless carriers on 10-20 year contracts

**Fiber optic networks:** Data transmission capacity leased to telecom and internet providers

**Data centers:** Facilities housing servers and computing infrastructure

Communications infrastructure benefits from growing data consumption and 5G network buildout.

**Social Infrastructure**

**Healthcare facilities:** Hospitals and medical office buildings with long-term leases

**Educational facilities:** Student housing, schools under public-private partnerships

**Government buildings:** Courthouses, administrative facilities with government tenants

Social infrastructure provides stable, often government-backed revenue streams.

**Energy Transition**

**Renewable generation:** Wind, solar, hydroelectric, and battery storage

**Electric vehicle charging networks:** Emerging infrastructure for transportation electrification

**Hydrogen production and distribution:** Developing clean energy infrastructure

Energy transition assets offer growth exposure while supporting decarbonization goals.

### Due Diligence: What to Evaluate

**Asset Quality and Competitive Position**

Assess the fundamental strength of underlying assets:

**Essentiality:** How critical is this infrastructure to users? Assets with no substitutes (the only bridge across a river) have stronger pricing power than those with alternatives.

**Barriers to Entry:** Regulatory licenses, high capital costs, and long development timelines protect existing assets from competition.

**Remaining Useful Life:** Assets with 30+ years of useful life require less near-term capital investment.

**Location Quality:** Toll roads in growing metropolitan areas generate more traffic than rural routes.

**Revenue Predictability**

Understand how revenue is generated and protected:

**Contract Structure:** Long-term contracts (10-30 years) with creditworthy counterparties provide stability. Review contract terms, renewal provisions, and termination rights.

**Inflation Protection:** Many infrastructure contracts include CPI escalators or formula-based rate increases, protecting purchasing power.

**Volume Risk:** Some assets bear traffic/volume risk (toll roads), while others have availability-based revenue (power plants paid to be available regardless of dispatch).

**Regulatory Framework:** Regulated utilities typically earn allowed returns on capital invested. Understand the regulatory jurisdiction and history of rate decisions.

**Operational Track Record**

Infrastructure requires active asset management:

**Operating History:** Review historical availability, capacity utilization, and operating costs.

**Maintenance and Capital Expenditure:** Understand ongoing maintenance needs and planned capital improvements.

**Operating Partner:** Many funds partner with specialized operators (airport managers, utility operators). Assess their experience and incentive alignment.

**Environmental Compliance:** Infrastructure assets must meet environmental regulations. Review compliance history and potential future requirements.

**Manager Expertise**

Infrastructure investing requires specialized knowledge:

**Sector Experience:** Managers should have deep expertise in target sectors—power generation requires different skills than transportation.

**Deal Sourcing:** Strong managers have networks providing proprietary deal flow and avoiding competitive auctions.

**Asset Management Capabilities:** Post-acquisition value creation through operational improvements, contract renegotiations, and strategic expansions.

**ESG Integration:** Infrastructure assets have environmental and social impacts. Leading managers integrate ESG considerations into investment decisions and asset management.

### Fee Structures and Economics

Infrastructure fund fees typically align with asset characteristics:

**Management Fees**

Most infrastructure funds charge 1.0-1.5% annually on committed capital during the investment period, then on invested capital or NAV thereafter. This is lower than PE's typical 2% due to infrastructure's lower-risk profile and operational nature.

**Performance Fees**

Carried interest typically ranges from 10-20% of profits above an 8% hurdle rate. The lower carry relative to PE (which typically uses 20%) reflects infrastructure's focus on steady income rather than aggressive appreciation.

**Transaction Fees**

Like PE, infrastructure managers may charge portfolio companies acquisition, financing, or advisory fees. Quality managers offset some or all of these fees against management fees owed by limited partners.

**Alignment Mechanisms**

Look for GP commitments of 2-5% of fund size, ensuring managers have personal capital invested alongside LPs. Clawback provisions protect LPs by allowing recovery of excess carry if later investments underperform.

### Risk Factors and Considerations

**Regulatory and Political Risk**

Infrastructure operates in regulated environments. Changes to regulatory frameworks, rate-setting methodologies, or political priorities can impact returns. Nationalization, while rare in developed markets, remains possible.

Mitigate this through:

**Geographic diversification across regulatory jurisdictions**

**Focus on essential services less subject to political interference**

**Investment in stable regulatory regimes with rule-of-law protections**

**Operational Risk**

Infrastructure assets require ongoing operations and maintenance. Poor management, deferred maintenance, or operational failures can damage assets and reduce cash flows.

Look for:

**Experienced operators with proven track records**

**Adequate capital reserves for maintenance**

**Insurance coverage for operational risks**

**Technology and Obsolescence Risk**

Some infrastructure faces disruption from new technologies. Toll roads compete with autonomous vehicles and remote work. Fossil fuel infrastructure faces transition risk from renewables.

Assess:

**Remaining useful life relative to technology evolution timelines**

**Asset flexibility to adapt to changing technology**

**Contractual protections against volume declines**

**Interest Rate Sensitivity**

Infrastructure valuations incorporate long-term cash flow projections discounted to present value. Rising interest rates increase discount rates, potentially reducing valuations.

However, many infrastructure assets have inflation-linked revenues that partially offset rate increases. Avoid overpaying during low-rate environments.

**Liquidity and Exit Risk**

Infrastructure investments typically require 10-15 year commitments. Secondary markets exist but may offer limited liquidity at discounted prices. Ensure clients can tolerate extended holding periods.

**Concentration Risk**

Some funds concentrate in single assets or sectors. While this can enhance returns, it increases exposure to asset-specific risks. Diversified funds holding 15-30 assets across sectors provide more stability.

### Tax Implications

Infrastructure investments have unique tax characteristics:

**Depreciation Benefits**

Infrastructure assets generate significant depreciation deductions, offsetting taxable income. This can result in tax-deferred cash distributions where investors receive cash flow but report lower taxable income.

**K-1 Complexity**

Infrastructure funds issue K-1 forms reflecting pass-through income, deductions, and credits. K-1s may include:

**Ordinary income from operations**

**Capital gains from asset sales**

**Depreciation and interest deductions**

**State-source income requiring multi-state tax filings**

Unrelated Business Taxable Income (UBTI)

Tax-exempt investors (IRAs, foundations) may face UBTI if infrastructure funds use debt financing, creating unexpected tax obligations.

**Recapture Provisions**

When assets are sold, previously claimed depreciation may be recaptured as ordinary income rather than capital gains, affecting after-tax returns.

**Renewable Energy Credits**

Investments in renewable infrastructure may generate tax credits (Investment Tax Credits, Production Tax Credits) that pass through to investors, enhancing after-tax returns.

### Client Suitability Assessment

Infrastructure suits specific client profiles:

**Income-Focused Investors**

Clients seeking current income benefit from infrastructure's steady distributions. Target yields typically range from 5-9% depending on risk profile.

**Inflation-Concerned Clients**

Those worried about purchasing power erosion appreciate infrastructure's inflation-protected revenue streams.

**Long-Term Patient Capital**

Clients must accept 10-15 year lockups. Those needing liquidity within five years should avoid traditional infrastructure funds.

**Risk-Adjusted Return Seekers**

Infrastructure typically targets 8-12% net returns—lower than PE but higher than bonds, with less volatility than both PE and public equities.

**ESG-Conscious Investors**

Infrastructure enables impact investing through renewable energy, public transportation, and water systems that deliver both returns and societal benefits.

### Portfolio Construction Considerations

**Strategic Allocation**

Institutions typically allocate 5-15% to infrastructure. Individual investors might target 3-10% depending on income needs and liquidity constraints.

Infrastructure sits between equities and bonds in risk-return profiles, providing:

**Higher yields than bonds**

**Lower volatility than equities**

**Inflation protection**

**Diversification benefits**

**Core vs. Core-Plus vs. Value-Add Strategies**

Different infrastructure strategies offer varying risk-return profiles:

**Core Infrastructure:** Mature, operational assets with long-term contracts or stable regulatory frameworks. Lower risk, yields of 5-8%, minimal leverage.

**Core-Plus:** Similar to core but may include some development risk, shorter contracts, or moderate leverage. Yields of 7-10%.

**Value-Add/Opportunistic:** Development projects, distressed assets, or higher-risk sectors. Targets returns of 12-15%+ with higher volatility.

Match strategy to client risk tolerance and return requirements.

**Geographic Diversification**

Spread investments across:

**Developed markets (OECD countries) for stability**

**Emerging markets for higher growth and yields**

**Different regulatory regimes to reduce jurisdiction-specific risk**

**Sector Diversification**

Blend defensive sectors (utilities, water) with growth-oriented sectors (renewable energy, data infrastructure) to balance stability and appreciation potential.

**MOIC (Multiple on Invested Capital):** Total value divided by invested capital

Quality infrastructure funds deliver:

**Consistent quarterly distributions**

**Net IRRs of 8-12% depending on strategy**

**Low volatility in NAV**

**Inflation-matching or inflation-beating returns**

### Key Takeaways for Advisors

Infrastructure provides unique portfolio benefits through steady income, inflation protection, and diversification. Unlike growth-oriented private equity, infrastructure emphasizes current cash flow from essential assets.

Success requires understanding different infrastructure sectors, assessing asset quality and revenue stability, and matching investment strategies to client needs. Core infrastructure suits income-focused, conservative clients. Value-add strategies fit those seeking higher returns with more risk.

Infrastructure's combination of bond-like income and equity-like appreciation makes it particularly valuable in today's environment of low bond yields and equity market uncertainty. For clients with appropriate time horizons and income objectives, infrastructure deserves consideration as a portfolio diversifier and income generator.
