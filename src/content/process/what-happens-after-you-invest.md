Once you've completed your pre-IPO investment, a new phase begins: monitoring your investment, understanding your tax obligations, and being prepared for potential corporate actions or liquidity events. While pre-IPO investments are generally long-term, passive holdings, staying informed about your investment's status and understanding key concepts like NAV, K-1 tax forms, and potential exit scenarios will help you manage your portfolio effectively.

### Monitoring Your Investment

After your investment closes, you'll receive confirmation via email and can access your investment summary and related documents through your portfolio page on the platform. From there, you can track the status and value of your holdings.

**Understanding Net Asset Value (NAV):** The Net Asset Value represents the estimated current value of your investment. For pre-IPO investments, calculating NAV involves more complexity than with public stocks because private company shares don't have real-time market prices. Instead, NAV is typically calculated using one of several methodologies:

**Last Round Valuation:** The most straightforward approach uses the price per share from the company's most recent funding round. If the company raised a Series D at $50 per share and your SPV holds 1,000 shares, the gross asset value would be $50,000.

**Secondary Market Transactions:** If there's active secondary market trading in the company's shares, recent transaction prices can inform NAV calculations. Platforms like Monark that facilitate ongoing secondary transactions can use this pricing data to establish reference values.

**Third-Party Valuations:** For some investments, independent valuation firms may be engaged to assess fair market value based on company financials, comparable company analysis, and industry trends.

**Mark-to-Market Adjustments:** When significant company events occur (new funding rounds, major customer wins or losses, market conditions, or industry developments), the NAV may be updated to reflect the new information.

It's important to understand that NAV is an estimate, not a guaranteed value. The actual value of your investment will only be realized when a liquidity event occurs—when the company goes public, gets acquired, or you're able to sell your shares in a secondary transaction. NAV calculations can help you track your investment's estimated performance, but they should be viewed as directional indicators rather than precise valuations.

**Reviewing Performance:** Most platforms provide regular updates (quarterly or annually) on your investments, including any NAV changes and company developments. These updates might include information about new funding rounds, significant business milestones, changes in company leadership, or market conditions affecting the company's sector. Staying informed about these developments helps you understand how your investment is progressing, though remember that pre-IPO investing is a long-term strategy—short-term fluctuations are less important than long-term trajectory.

### Tax Considerations and K-1 Forms

Pre-IPO investments in SPVs structured as LLCs involve different tax reporting than public stock investments. Understanding these requirements helps you avoid surprises at tax time.

**What is a K-1?:** When you invest in an SPV structured as a partnership or LLC (which is typical for pre-IPO funds), you'll receive a Schedule K-1 tax form each year rather than a 1099 form. The K-1 reports your proportional share of the SPV's income, deductions, and credits for the tax year. Even if the SPV doesn't distribute any cash to you during the year, you may owe taxes on your share of the SPV's income.

**K-1 Timing:** K-1 forms are typically distributed later than 1099 forms—often in March or even April—because the SPV must complete its own tax reporting before generating K-1s for investors. If you typically file your taxes early, you'll need to wait for your K-1s before filing, or file an extension.

**What K-1s Include:** Your K-1 will report various items of income, deductions, and credits allocated to you based on your ownership percentage. For most pre-IPO SPVs that simply hold shares without generating income, K-1s may show minimal activity until an exit event. However, if the underlying company pays dividends or the SPV incurs expenses, these will flow through to your K-1.

**Working with Tax Professionals:** Many investors find it helpful to work with accountants or tax professionals familiar with partnership taxation when dealing with K-1s, especially if they hold multiple SPV investments. The tax treatment can be complex, and professional guidance ensures you're reporting correctly and taking advantage of any available deductions or credits.

### Secondary Trading Opportunities

While pre-IPO investments are generally illiquid with expected holding periods of 2-10 years, some platforms offer secondary trading opportunities through Alternative Trading Systems (ATS). For most SPVs, secondary trading can begin on an ATS after an initial 1 year hold period.

**What is an ATS?:** An Alternative Trading System is a regulated platform that facilitates trading of securities outside traditional stock exchanges. For pre-IPO shares, an ATS allows investors to potentially sell their SPV membership interests or underlying company shares to other accredited investors before the company goes public.

**How Secondary Trading Works:** If you need liquidity before an IPO or acquisition, you may be able to list your investment for sale on an ATS. Other investors can view available offerings and potentially purchase your position. However, several important caveats apply:

**No Guarantee of Sale:** Unlike public stocks that have continuous liquidity, private shares may not have buyers at any given time. You might need to wait for interested parties or price your offering attractively to generate interest.

**Company Approval May Be Required:** Many private companies maintain transfer restrictions requiring them to approve any share transfers, even on secondary markets. This approval process can affect timing and certainty.

**Pricing Considerations:** You may need to price your offering at a discount to current estimated value to attract buyers, especially if you're seeking quick liquidity.

**SPV-Specific Rules:** Some SPVs have their own rules, fees, and processes. Familiarize yourself with these before attempting to sell. These will be made clear and accessible prior to any secondary trading activity in the SPV commencing.

Secondary trading can provide a valuable liquidity option if your circumstances change, but it's best to invest in pre-IPO opportunities with the expectation that you'll hold until a formal exit event.

### Corporate Actions and Their Impact

During your holding period, the underlying company may undergo various corporate actions that affect your investment. Understanding these scenarios helps you know what to expect:

**Acquisition:** If the company gets acquired for cash, this represents a liquidity event for investors. The SPV will receive cash proceeds for its shares based on the acquisition price and terms. After satisfying any liquidation preferences senior to your share class, the SPV will distribute remaining proceeds to investors proportionally. You'll receive your pro-rata share of the distribution, which represents the return on your investment. The distribution timing depends on the acquisition closing timeline, but you can typically expect to receive funds within weeks of the transaction closing.

**Merger or Stock Split:** If the company merges with another company or undergoes a stock split, your equity stake will adjust to reflect the change in capital structure, similar to how these events work in public markets. For example, in a 2-for-1 stock split, the SPV's 1,000 shares would become 2,000 shares, but each share would be worth proportionally less, maintaining the same total value. In a merger, your shares might convert into shares of the combined entity based on the exchange ratio. These corporate actions don't immediately create liquidity but change the structure of your ownership.

**Initial Public Offering (IPO):** This is often the most anticipated exit scenario for pre-IPO investors. When the company goes public, the SPV's shares will typically convert into publicly traded shares at the IPO price. Depending on the SPV structure and any lockup agreements, you may receive your shares directly (becoming a shareholder of the now-public company) or the SPV may liquidate the position and distribute cash proceeds. Many IPOs include lockup periods (often 180 days) during which pre-IPO shareholders cannot sell their shares, designed to prevent excessive selling pressure on the newly public stock. After the lockup expires, you can sell your shares on public markets if you choose, or continue holding for potential additional appreciation.

**Follow-On Funding Rounds:** If the company raises additional capital through new funding rounds, this typically doesn't require any action from you, but it will affect your investment. New funding rounds can be positive (indicating growth and investor demand) or dilutive (reducing your percentage ownership if new shares are issued). The impact on your investment value depends on the funding round's valuation—if it occurs at a higher valuation than your investment price, it's typically positive; if it's a "down round" at a lower valuation, it may negatively impact your position.

**Bankruptcy or Restructuring:** As with public company investments, if the underlying company faces financial distress, your investment may lose significant value or become worthless. The outcome depends on the specific situation and your share class's position in the capital structure. Preferred shares with liquidation preferences have priority over common shares in bankruptcy scenarios. This is one reason why thorough due diligence and portfolio diversification are essential in pre-IPO investing—not every company will succeed, and being prepared for this possibility helps you manage risk appropriately.

### Staying Connected

Throughout your holding period, platforms typically provide updates on your investments through several channels:

**Email notifications:** Important company developments, funding rounds, or platform updates

**Portfolio dashboard:** Access to current NAV estimates, transaction history, and documents

**Annual reports:** Summary of SPV performance and any distributions

**Company updates:** Some platforms share relevant news articles or company announcements

Staying engaged with these communications helps you remain informed about your investments without requiring active management. Pre-IPO investing is largely a passive, long-term strategy, but informed passive investing is more effective than blind hope.

Pre-IPO investments represent a unique asset class with their own rhythms and requirements. By understanding how to monitor your investments through NAV, managing your tax obligations with K-1 forms, recognizing potential secondary trading opportunities, and being prepared for various corporate action scenarios, you can navigate the post-investment period confidently. While these investments require patience and a longer-term perspective than public stocks, the potential for enhanced returns and access to innovative companies makes them a compelling component of a diversified investment portfolio for those willing to embrace their unique characteristics.
