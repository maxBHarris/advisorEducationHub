# Understanding Liquidity in Registered Alternative Funds

One of the most significant advantages registered alternative funds offer over traditional private funds is improved liquidity. While private funds typically lock up capital for 7-10 years with no early exit options, registered alternatives provide various liquidity mechanisms—quarterly redemptions, daily trading, or periodic tender offers.

But liquidity in alternatives comes with important caveats and limitations. Understanding how different liquidity mechanisms work, their restrictions, and the potential challenges helps you set appropriate expectations and avoid surprises when you or your clients need to access capital.

## Why Liquidity Matters Differently in Alternatives

Traditional mutual funds invest in liquid securities—stocks and bonds that can be sold within days. When investors redeem shares, fund managers simply sell enough securities to raise cash, process the redemption, and move on.

Alternative funds own illiquid assets—private company loans, commercial real estate, infrastructure projects—that can't be sold quickly without significant discounts. A private credit fund can't instantly sell a $10 million loan to a middle-market company. A real estate fund can't liquidate an office building in days.

This fundamental mismatch between investor liquidity expectations and asset liquidity creates challenges registered alternatives must manage carefully.

## Interval Funds: Quarterly Redemption Windows

Interval funds represent the most common registered structure for illiquid alternative strategies. Understanding how their liquidity mechanism works is essential.

**How Interval Fund Redemptions Work**

Interval funds offer periodic repurchase offers, typically quarterly, for a limited percentage of outstanding shares (usually 5-25% of fund assets). Here's the process:

**1. Repurchase Offer Announcement**

The fund announces a repurchase offer 21-42 days before the repurchase pricing date. The announcement specifies:

- The repurchase pricing date (when shares are valued)
- The repurchase percentage (what portion of fund assets will be repurchased)
- The tender deadline (when redemption requests must be submitted)
- The expected payment date

For example: "The fund will offer to repurchase up to 5% of outstanding shares at NAV calculated on March 31, 2026. Tender requests must be received by March 25, 2026. Payment will be made by April 15, 2026."

**2. Submitting Redemption Requests**

Investors submit tender requests by the deadline, specifying:

- How many shares they want to redeem
- Whether the request is "all-or-none" (must be fully filled or canceled) or can be prorated

You don't know the exact redemption price when submitting your request since it's calculated on the future pricing date.

**3. Proration**

If total redemption requests exceed the repurchase percentage (say, 8% of fund assets when the fund offered 5%), the fund prorates all requests proportionally.

If you requested to redeem $10,000 and requests totaled 8% while the offer was for 5%, you'd receive approximately 62.5% of your request ($6,250), with the remainder staying invested.

**4. Pricing and Settlement**

The fund calculates NAV on the repurchase pricing date. Redemptions are processed at this NAV, with payments typically made within 7-14 days.

**Key Limitations**

Several factors constrain interval fund liquidity:

**Repurchase Caps**: The 5-25% quarterly limit means you may not be able to exit your full position in a single quarter. Complete liquidation might take 4-5 quarters even if redemptions aren't prorated.

**Proration Risk**: During market stress or fund performance issues, redemption requests often exceed limits, resulting in significant proration. You might receive only 25-50% of your requested redemption.

**Suspension Authority**: Funds can suspend repurchase offers entirely if:

- Redemptions would force sales at disadvantageous prices
- Market conditions make valuations unreliable
- Regulatory requirements necessitate suspension

While rare, suspensions can trap capital when you most need liquidity.

**Processing Time**: Even successful redemptions take 2-3 weeks from tender deadline to payment receipt, unlike same-day settlement for stocks.

## Business Development Companies: Daily Exchange Trading

BDCs offer daily liquidity through exchange trading, similar to stocks. You can buy or sell shares any trading day at market prices. This sounds ideal but comes with important considerations.

**Trading at Market Prices vs. NAV**

BDCs calculate NAV quarterly based on portfolio valuations, but shares trade at market prices determined by supply and demand.

Market prices frequently diverge from NAV:

- **Premiums**: Shares trading above NAV (e.g., $11 per share when NAV is $10)
- **Discounts**: Shares trading below NAV (e.g., $9 per share when NAV is $10)

Discounts and premiums fluctuate based on:

- Market sentiment toward the BDC sector
- Interest rate expectations
- Credit market conditions
- Company-specific factors (dividend sustainability, portfolio quality)
- General equity market volatility

**Implications for Investors**

Trading at premiums or discounts creates economic consequences:

If you buy shares at a 10% premium ($11 when NAV is $10), you need the NAV to increase more than 10% just to break even if the premium disappears.

If shares trade at a 15% discount when you need to sell, you realize a 15% loss even if the underlying portfolio maintained its value.

**Historical Volatility**

During the March 2020 COVID crisis, many BDCs traded at 30-50% discounts to NAV as investors panic-sold. While NAVs declined 10-20% reflecting credit deterioration, market prices fell far more. Investors who sold at these discounts crystallized losses far exceeding underlying portfolio declines.

Conversely, during strong markets, BDCs often trade at 10-20% premiums, requiring new investors to pay above intrinsic value.

**Benefits of Exchange Trading**

Despite premium/discount volatility, daily liquidity offers advantages:

- Immediate access to capital without waiting for quarterly windows
- No proration—you can sell your entire position at once
- Transparent real-time pricing
- Ability to use limit orders and other trading strategies

BDC liquidity works best for investors who:

- Can tolerate price volatility
- Plan to hold long-term through premium/discount fluctuations
- Don't need to access capital during market stress

## Tender Offer Funds: Manager-Controlled Liquidity

Some registered funds use tender offers rather than regular interval repurchases. The fund announces when it will offer to repurchase shares, rather than maintaining a set quarterly schedule.

**How Tender Offers Work**

The manager decides when to offer liquidity based on:

- Available cash from portfolio company exits or asset sales
- Market conditions for selling portfolio holdings
- Expected future cash needs
- Investor demand for liquidity

Tender offers might occur quarterly, semi-annually, or opportunistically. Investors don't know when the next offer will occur until announced.

**Advantages**

- Managers can align liquidity provision with portfolio cash generation
- Avoids forced sales at disadvantageous times
- More flexibility than fixed interval schedules

**Disadvantages**

- Unpredictable timing creates planning challenges
- Potential for extended periods without liquidity opportunities
- Less transparency about future access to capital

Tender offer structures suit strategies with unpredictable cash flows (opportunistic private equity, development real estate) but require higher investor liquidity tolerance.

## Closed-End Funds: Exchange Trading with No NAV Redemptions

Registered closed-end funds trade on exchanges like BDCs but don't offer NAV redemptions or repurchase programs. You can only exit by selling shares to other investors at market prices.

Like BDCs, closed-end funds frequently trade at significant premiums or discounts to NAV. Some closed-end funds implement managed distribution policies, share repurchase programs, or other mechanisms to reduce discount volatility, but premium/discount risk remains substantial.

## Managing Liquidity in Your Portfolio

Understanding these liquidity mechanisms helps you structure alternatives allocations appropriately:

**Match Liquidity to Client Needs**

**Conservative Liquidity Needs**: Clients requiring access to capital within 1-2 years should avoid interval funds and focus on BDCs or closed-end funds with exchange liquidity, despite premium/discount risk.

**Moderate Liquidity Needs**: Those comfortable waiting 1-2 quarters for potential access can use interval funds, understanding proration risk.

**Patient Capital**: Clients with 3-5 year horizons can accept tender offer funds with less predictable liquidity timing.

**Size Positions Appropriately**

Don't allocate more to interval funds than you can afford to have locked up for 1-2 years. If a client has $100,000 in alternatives and needs liquidity within a year, interval funds should represent only a portion—perhaps $30,000-$50,000—with the remainder in more liquid vehicles.

**Maintain Liquidity Reserves**

Never put all investable assets into alternatives with limited liquidity. Maintain reserves in truly liquid investments (cash, money market funds, publicly traded bonds) to handle unexpected needs without forced alternative sales at disadvantageous times.

**Plan for Proration**

When modeling portfolio liquidity, assume 50% proration on interval fund redemptions during ordinary conditions and potentially 0% access during market stress. This conservative assumption prevents over-reliance on alternatives liquidity.

**Understand Premium/Discount Dynamics**

For BDCs and closed-end funds, track premium/discount history. Avoid buying at extreme premiums. Consider buying at discounts if you have conviction in underlying portfolio quality and can hold through volatility.

## What Happens During Market Stress

Liquidity mechanisms face their greatest tests during market crises. Understanding stress scenarios helps you prepare:

**Interval Fund Stress Scenarios**

During significant market downturns or credit crises:

- Redemption requests spike as investors seek cash
- Proration increases significantly (you might receive only 20-30% of requested redemptions)
- Boards may reduce repurchase percentages from 5% to 2-3% or suspend offers entirely
- NAV declines may accompany reduced liquidity, creating double pain

The March 2020 COVID crisis saw some interval funds suspend repurchases while others continued with heavy proration. Investors unable to access capital faced difficult choices about whether to continue tendering or wait out the crisis.

**BDC Stress Scenarios**

Exchange-traded BDCs faced dramatic price declines during COVID:

- Discounts to NAV widened to 30-50% as investors panicked
- Daily liquidity remained available, but at severely depressed prices
- Investors who sold at these discounts crystallized massive losses
- Those who held through recovered most value as discounts narrowed

Daily liquidity proved to be a double-edged sword—available when needed but only at punishing prices.

## Redemption Fees and Gates

Some funds impose additional liquidity constraints:

**Redemption Fees**

Funds may charge 1-2% redemption fees on shares held less than 1-2 years to discourage short-term trading and compensate long-term shareholders for liquidity provision costs.

These fees reduce the proceeds you receive from redemptions.

**Gates**

Some funds reserve the right to limit total redemptions to a percentage of fund assets over rolling periods (e.g., 10% annually). Gates provide additional protection against runs but further restrict liquidity.

Always review prospectus disclosure about redemption fees and gates before investing.

## Tax Considerations in Redemptions

Redeeming interval fund shares or selling BDC shares creates taxable events:

- Capital gains or losses based on your cost basis
- Holding period determines short-term (ordinary income rates) vs. long-term treatment
- Redemption proceeds arrive 2-3 weeks after tender, potentially creating cash flow timing issues if you need funds for tax payments

Plan redemptions with tax implications in mind, especially for December year-end redemptions that might push income into the current tax year.

## Comparing Liquidity Across Structures

Understanding the trade-offs helps you select appropriate vehicles:

| Feature               | Interval Funds           | BDCs                | Tender Offer Funds | Closed-End Funds |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| Liquidity Frequency   | Quarterly                | Daily               | Variable           | Daily            |
| Pricing               | NAV                      | Market Price        | NAV                | Market Price     |
| Proration Risk        | Yes                      | No                  | Yes                | No               |
| Suspension Risk       | Yes                      | No                  | Yes                | No               |
| Premium/Discount Risk | No                       | Yes                 | No                 | Yes              |
| Predictability        | High                     | N/A                 | Low                | N/A              |
| Best For              | Moderate liquidity needs | Maximum flexibility | Patient capital    | Active traders   |

## Setting Realistic Expectations

When discussing alternatives with clients, be honest about liquidity:

**What Clients Should Expect:**

- Quarterly access opportunities (interval funds)
- Potential proration reducing actual liquidity
- Processing delays of 2-4 weeks from request to payment
- Possibility of suspensions during extreme stress
- Premium/discount volatility for exchange-traded vehicles

**What Clients Should NOT Expect:**

- Same-day liquidity like bank accounts
- Guaranteed access to full capital on demand
- Stable redemption prices disconnected from market conditions
- Liquidity during crises without economic cost

Managing expectations prevents panic redemptions and poor decision-making during stress periods.

## Strategies for Optimizing Liquidity

**Laddering**

Invest in multiple interval funds with staggered repurchase dates, creating monthly or bi-monthly potential liquidity rather than quarterly.

**Blending Structures**

Combine interval funds (predictable but limited) with BDCs (volatile but always available) to balance liquidity characteristics.

**Maintaining Dry Powder**

Keep some alternative allocation uncommitted in liquid securities, allowing you to wait for optimal redemption timing rather than forced sales.

**Strategic Redemptions**

When you need partial liquidity, redeem from funds trading at premiums to NAV (for BDCs) or make small quarterly interval fund redemptions rather than large requests that ensure proration.

## The Bottom Line

Liquidity in registered alternative funds represents a significant improvement over traditional private funds' multi-year lockups, but it's not equivalent to mutual fund or stock liquidity.

Interval funds offer predictable quarterly access with limits and proration risk. BDCs provide daily liquidity at volatile market prices disconnected from NAV. Tender offer funds give manager-controlled intermittent access. Each structure has trade-offs requiring careful consideration.

Success requires realistic expectations, appropriate position sizing, maintained liquidity reserves, and understanding that alternatives liquidity is most constrained exactly when you might most need it—during market stress.

For clients who understand these constraints and plan accordingly, registered alternatives' improved liquidity makes sophisticated institutional strategies accessible and manageable within diversified portfolios. The key is matching liquidity structures to client circumstances, avoiding over-allocation, and maintaining perspective that alternatives are long-term holdings occasionally requiring patience before accessing capital.
