# What Are Registered Funds and How They Differ from Private Funds

Alternative investments have traditionally been the domain of institutional investors and ultra-high-net-worth individuals accessing private funds with high minimums, long lockups, and limited oversight. Registered funds are changing that equation, bringing alternative investment strategies to a broader investor base through structures designed for accessibility, transparency, and regulatory protection.

Understanding the difference between registered and private funds helps you determine which structure best serves your clients' needs and circumstances.

## The Fundamental Difference

The core distinction comes down to regulatory framework and investor protections.

**Private funds** operate under exemptions from securities registration requirements—typically Regulation D or Section 3(c)(1) and 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. These exemptions allow fund managers flexibility in strategy, fees, and operations, but limit who can invest (typically accredited investors or qualified purchasers) and impose minimal disclosure requirements.

**Registered funds** are securities registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933 and regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940. This registration subjects them to comprehensive disclosure requirements, operational standards, and investor protections.

The trade-off is straightforward: registered funds sacrifice some operational flexibility in exchange for broader accessibility and standardized investor protections.

## Common Registered Fund Structures for Alternatives

Several registered fund structures provide access to alternative strategies:

**Interval Funds**

Interval funds are closed-end funds that offer periodic redemption windows (typically quarterly) for a limited percentage of fund assets (usually 5-25%). Between these windows, shares are illiquid.

This structure works well for alternative strategies requiring some illiquidity—private credit, real estate, infrastructure—where the underlying investments can't be sold immediately but managers can plan for periodic liquidity needs.

You invest $100,000 in an interval fund offering quarterly redemptions of up to 10% of fund assets. Each quarter, you can request redemption of your shares, though the fund may prorate requests if total redemptions exceed the 10% limit.

Interval funds typically have lower minimums ($2,500-$25,000) than private funds and provide more frequent valuation and reporting.

**Tender Offer Funds**

Similar to interval funds, tender offer funds periodically offer to repurchase shares from investors. The key difference: the fund controls when and how much to repurchase, rather than offering regular quarterly windows.

Tender offers might occur quarterly, semi-annually, or opportunistically when the manager determines liquidity is available. This gives managers more control over capital flows but less predictability for investors.

**Business Development Companies (BDCs)**

BDCs are specialized registered investment companies that invest in small and mid-sized private companies, primarily through debt investments. Most BDCs trade on stock exchanges, providing daily liquidity.

BDCs must distribute at least 90% of taxable income to shareholders as dividends, making them attractive for income-focused investors. They provide transparency through public filings and quarterly earnings calls, though trading prices can disconnect from net asset value.

**Registered Closed-End Funds**

Traditional closed-end funds issue a fixed number of shares in an initial offering, then trade on exchanges. Some invest in alternative strategies like infrastructure, real estate, or private credit.

These funds offer daily liquidity but trade at market prices that may diverge from NAV, sometimes at significant premiums or discounts.

**'40 Act Funds with Alternative Strategies**

Some mutual funds and ETFs registered under the 1940 Act employ alternative strategies—long-short equity, managed futures, event-driven—while maintaining daily liquidity. These "liquid alts" provide alternatives exposure without lockups, though return profiles may differ from pure private funds due to liquidity constraints.

## Key Differences in Practice

Understanding how registered and private funds differ operationally helps you set appropriate client expectations:

**Investor Eligibility**

Private funds typically restrict investment to:

- Accredited investors (income >$200K or net worth >$1M excluding primary residence)
- Qualified purchasers (investments >$5M) for 3(c)(7) funds

Registered funds are available to all investors meeting minimum investment requirements, typically $2,500-$25,000. This democratization makes alternatives accessible to a broader client base.

**Minimum Investments**

Private funds often require $100K-$1M minimums, limiting access to wealthy clients. Registered funds typically start at $2,500-$25,000, allowing broader portfolio diversification across alternative strategies.

**Liquidity Terms**

Private funds impose multi-year lockups (often 5-10 years) with limited early withdrawal rights, usually subject to penalties.

Registered interval and tender offer funds provide periodic liquidity (quarterly or semi-annually), though redemptions may be limited to 5-25% of assets per period. BDCs and closed-end funds offer daily liquidity through exchange trading, though at market prices rather than NAV.

**Fee Structures**

Both structures charge management fees and performance fees, but presentation differs:

Private funds typically charge 1-2% management fees plus 15-20% performance fees (carried interest) above hurdle rates.

Registered funds disclose fees as expense ratios in prospectuses. Interval funds commonly charge 2-3% management fees and 10-20% performance fees, presented as total expense ratios and performance allocations. BDCs charge management fees plus incentive fees on income and gains.

The total economic cost may be similar, but registered fund fee disclosure is more standardized and transparent.

**Regulatory Oversight and Reporting**

This is where differences become most significant:

**Private Funds:**

- Limited disclosure requirements, often just annual audited financials
- Quarterly statements to investors
- No required prospectus or standardized offering documents
- Fewer restrictions on investment activities and conflicts of interest

**Registered Funds:**

- Detailed prospectus required, updated annually
- Statement of Additional Information (SAI) providing expanded disclosure
- Quarterly and annual reports to shareholders
- Daily NAV calculation and publication (for daily liquidity funds)
- Restrictions on affiliate transactions and conflicts
- Board of directors/trustees including independent members overseeing manager
- SEC examination and oversight

Clients receive substantially more information and protection with registered funds, though this comes with operational costs reflected in expense ratios.

**Valuation and Transparency**

Private funds typically value portfolios quarterly, with significant discretion in valuing illiquid holdings. NAV is estimated rather than marked to market.

Registered interval funds value portfolios at least quarterly, following specific valuation procedures approved by the board. BDCs and exchange-traded closed-end funds value portfolios at least quarterly with significant disclosure around methodology.

While both structures face valuation challenges for illiquid assets, registered funds must follow standardized procedures with board oversight.

**Tax Reporting**

Private funds issue K-1 forms reporting partnership income, gains, and deductions. K-1s arrive late (often March or April), include complex allocations, and may trigger multi-state filing requirements.

Registered funds structured as corporations (like BDCs) issue simpler 1099-DIV forms for dividend income. Registered funds structured as partnerships still issue K-1s, but some use blockers to simplify taxation for certain investors.

The tax treatment depends more on fund structure (partnership vs. corporation) than registered vs. private status, but registered funds often prioritize simplified tax reporting.

## When Registered Funds Make Sense

Registered alternative funds work well for clients who:

**Need Some Liquidity**

Clients uncomfortable locking up capital for 10 years benefit from interval funds' quarterly redemption windows or BDCs' daily liquidity, even if these options are imperfect.

**Have Smaller Capital Allocations**

The $2,500-$25,000 minimums allow diversification across multiple alternative strategies rather than concentrating in one $100K+ private fund commitment.

**Value Regulatory Protections**

Risk-averse clients appreciate standardized disclosure, board oversight, and SEC regulation, accepting somewhat higher expense ratios for these protections.

**Prefer Simpler Tax Reporting**

Those frustrated by K-1 complexity may prefer registered funds structured as corporations issuing 1099s.

**Want Alternatives Exposure Without Illiquidity**

Clients dipping toes into alternatives may start with interval funds or BDCs offering some liquidity before committing to fully illiquid private funds.

## When Private Funds Remain Preferable

Private funds continue serving clients who:

**Can Commit Capital Long-Term**

Illiquidity allows managers to invest in assets with superior return potential without worrying about redemptions. Clients with 10+ year horizons may achieve better returns accepting full illiquidity.

**Meet Higher Minimums Comfortably**

Concentrated positions in carefully selected private funds with institutional-quality managers may outperform diversified registered fund approaches.

**Access Top-Tier Managers**

The best private equity, real estate, and credit managers often don't offer registered products, preferring traditional partnership structures.

**Seek Maximum Tax Efficiency**

Partnership structures offer tax planning opportunities (depreciation, tax credits) that corporate registered funds can't match.

**Value Operational Flexibility**

Private funds can pursue opportunistic strategies, concentrated positions, and flexible capital deployment that registered fund restrictions prohibit.

## The Convergence Trend

The line between registered and private funds is blurring. High-quality alternative managers increasingly offer both:

- Private funds for institutional investors and wealthy individuals seeking maximum returns with full illiquidity
- Registered interval funds or BDCs bringing similar strategies to broader audiences with modified liquidity terms

This trend democratizes alternatives access while allowing clients to choose structures matching their liquidity needs and regulatory preferences.

Many managers find their registered and private strategies perform similarly over time, suggesting the structures can coexist effectively.

## Making the Choice

The decision between registered and private alternative funds isn't binary. Consider:

**Portfolio Allocation**: Use registered funds for initial alternatives exposure or clients with smaller allocations. Graduate to private funds as allocations grow and conviction increases.

**Strategy Fit**: Some strategies (private credit, real estate debt) work well in interval funds. Others (venture capital, opportunistic real estate) require full illiquidity of private structures.

**Client Circumstances**: Liquidity needs, tax situations, minimum investment capacity, and regulatory preferences drive individual decisions.

**Manager Quality**: Choose the best manager for the strategy regardless of structure. A top-tier registered fund may outperform a mediocre private fund.

## The Bottom Line

Registered alternative funds make institutional-quality strategies accessible to a broader investor base through standardized structures, regulatory protections, and improved liquidity. They sacrifice some return potential and operational flexibility compared to private funds, but offer meaningful benefits for many clients.

Understanding the structural differences helps you match fund types to client circumstances. For some clients, registered interval funds or BDCs provide ideal alternatives exposure. For others, traditional private funds better serve long-term wealth building.

The expansion of registered alternatives represents progress, expanding access to strategies once reserved for institutions and the ultra-wealthy. Both structures have their place in comprehensive alternatives allocations.
