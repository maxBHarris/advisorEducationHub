Pre-IPO investing means buying shares in private companies before they go public. But we're not talking about early-stage startups here. Pre-IPO companies are typically high-growth, venture-backed businesses that have already proven their business model, built substantial revenue, and established themselves in their markets. Think companies like SpaceX, OpenAI, or Anthropic—they're private, but they're not small.

These investments offer accredited investors a chance to access some of the world's most innovative companies during a critical growth phase, before those companies become available on public stock exchanges.

### Why Pre-IPO Returns Can Be Different

Pre-IPO investments come with the potential for higher returns than public stocks. That premium comes from three main factors:

**The Illiquidity Premium**

When you buy a public stock, you can sell it the next day. When you invest in a pre-IPO company, your money is typically locked up for 2-10 years until the company goes public or gets acquired.

Investors expect—and historically have received—higher returns as compensation for this lack of liquidity. This "illiquidity premium" is real and it's priced into private company valuations. You're giving up flexibility in exchange for the potential for outsized returns.

**Limited Transparency**

Private companies aren't required to disclose nearly as much information as public companies. No quarterly earnings calls. No 10-Ks or 10-Qs. This creates risk, but for investors who do their homework, it also creates opportunity.

The information gap means you need to dig deeper and understand what you're buying. But it also means you can identify great companies before the rest of the market catches on.

**Access to Exceptional Growth**

**Here's the reality:** For certain innovative companies, pre-IPO investing is the only way individual investors can participate in their growth.

By the time many companies go public, their explosive growth phase is already behind them. Companies that IPO today have often been private for over a decade, building value that early investors captured but public market investors missed entirely.

If you want exposure to the next generation of transformative companies—the ones building AI, reinventing industries, or creating new markets—you often need to invest before they're public.

### Why This Matters Now

The investment landscape has fundamentally changed. Over the last 30 years:

**The number of public companies has dropped by 50%**

**The number of private companies has grown by 43%**

The average time a company stays private before IPO has gone from 5 years to 13 years

What does this mean for you? Some of today's most important companies are building massive value as private companies. Over 19,000 private U.S. companies generate more than $100 million in revenue. Twenty years ago, most of them would have already gone public. Today, they're staying private longer, accessing private capital markets without the regulatory burden of being public.

If you want exposure to the companies shaping the future, you need access to private markets.

### How Pre-IPO Investing Actually Works

Modern pre-IPO investing happens through Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs)—also called single-company funds. Here's how it works:

**Pooling Capital**

Individual investors contribute capital to an SPV. The SPV aggregates this money to purchase shares of a specific private company. This structure solves a practical problem: private companies don't want dozens or hundreds of individual shareholders on their cap table. An SPV shows up as one entity, making everyone's life easier.

**The Transaction Process**

Most pre-IPO transactions are secondary transactions—meaning you're buying existing shares from current shareholders (often employees or early investors) rather than new shares directly from the company.

The process includes:

**Sourcing shares from selling shareholders**

Getting company approval (most private companies have a Right of First Refusal)

**Managing regulatory compliance**

**Handling the actual transfer of shares**

Platforms like Monark handle all of this, but it still takes time—typically 1-4 weeks from investment to close.

**Your Ownership**

When you invest in an SPV, you're buying membership interests in that SPV. The SPV owns shares of the private company. You own your pro-rata portion of whatever the SPV holds.

If the SPV owns 10,000 shares and you invested $10,000 out of a $1 million SPV, you own 1%—which translates to indirect ownership of 100 shares of the underlying company.

### What Investment Opportunities Look Like

Accredited investors can access pre-IPO companies through several structures:

**Single-Company Funds**

This is the most common option. You invest in one specific private company through an SPV. Investment minimums typically start at $10,000, though some platforms offer $5,000 minimums for select deals.

You're making a concentrated bet on one company, which means you should understand that business, its market, and its growth prospects.

**Multi-Company Funds**

Want diversification? Multi-company funds spread your capital across multiple private companies, reducing the risk that any single company drags down your returns.

These funds help you build exposure to the pre-IPO asset class without concentrating all your risk in one name.

**Direct Investments**

For larger investors, direct purchases from selling shareholders are sometimes available, though these typically require significantly higher minimums.

### How to Get Started

Investing in pre-IPO companies involves three steps:

**Step 1:** Verify You're Accredited

Pre-IPO investments are limited to accredited investors. You qualify if you have:

Annual income of at least $200,000 (or $300,000 combined with a spouse) for the last two years, with expectation of the same for the current year

**Net worth exceeding $1 million, excluding your primary residence**

Certain professional certifications (Series 7, 65, or 82)

**Step 2:** Discover Companies and Indicate Interest

Browse available opportunities on platforms that offer pre-IPO access. New single-company funds typically launch on regular schedules (for example, Monark launches new deals every Tuesday and Thursday).

When you find companies you're interested in, you can indicate your interest or add it to your watchlist. This signals demand to the platform and ensures you get notified when new opportunities become available.

**Step 3:** Complete Your Investment

Once you find an opportunity you want to invest in:

Review the offering documents (company information, cap table, risks)

**Complete a non-binding term sheet to reserve your allocation**

Sign the subscription agreement (this is binding)

**Provide funding via ACH or wire transfer**

**Wait for company approval and the closing process**

The whole process takes 6-10 weeks from investment to close, but you'll have visibility into where things stand throughout.

### What to Keep in Mind

Pre-IPO investing offers compelling opportunities, but it's not without risks:

**Your money is illiquid for years**

**Not all companies go public or get acquired**

**You could lose your entire investment**

**Information is more limited than with public stocks**

That said, for accredited investors looking to access high-growth companies and potentially achieve returns that outperform public markets, pre-IPO investing has become an increasingly important part of a diversified portfolio.

The key is understanding what you're buying, doing your research, and only investing capital you can afford to have locked up for several years.
