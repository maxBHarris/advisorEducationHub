When you invest in a pre-IPO company through a platform, your investment goes through a Special Purpose Vehicle—an SPV. Understanding what SPVs are and how they work is essential. These vehicles make pre-IPO investing possible for individual investors, bridging the gap between you and private company shares.

### SPVs Solve a Real Problem

**Here's the challenge:** Private companies don't want hundreds of individual investors on their cap table. It creates administrative burdens, complicates governance, and makes future fundraising more difficult.

At the same time, individual investors can't meet the minimum investment sizes private companies require. A single share purchase might require $20 million, $100 million, or more. That's not accessible to most investors.

SPVs solve both problems. They're legal entities—typically Delaware limited liability companies (LLCs)—created for one specific purpose: to pool capital from multiple investors and purchase shares of a private company.

By aggregating capital, SPVs can meet the minimums needed to transact. And instead of adding dozens or hundreds of new names to their cap table, private companies see just one entity: the SPV.

### What You Actually Own

When you invest in an SPV, you're not buying shares of the private company directly. You're buying membership interests in the SPV, which owns shares of the company.

Here's how it works:

An SPV raises $1 million from investors and uses that capital to purchase 10,000 shares of Company X at $100 per share. If you invested $10,000, you own 1% of the SPV. That 1% translates to indirect ownership of 100 shares of Company X (1% of the SPV's 10,000 shares).

Your ownership is formalized through legal documents you sign during the investment process—particularly the Subscription Agreement. These documents spell out:

**Your proportional ownership of the underlying shares**

**Your rights to distributions when the company exits**

**Any voting or governance rights that flow through the SPV**

**Your obligations as an SPV member**

Generally, SPVs will not provide voting, governance rights, or other obligations to end investors. This is to minimize investor administrative overhead, and provide the cleaning "like-public markets" investment experience. With nearly 50% of Pre-IPO volume transacted in SPVs through 2025, they have been solidified as the de facto method of transacting in Pre-IPO.

### How SPVs Protect Your Investment

Several mechanisms ensure your ownership is protected:

**Company Approval**

Every private company approves the transfer of shares to the SPV. This isn't just a formality—it's the company formally acknowledging the SPV's ownership. That acknowledgment affirms your indirect ownership as an SPV member.

Most private companies have a Right of First Refusal (ROFR), which means they have the option to buy shares before they're sold to a third party. Reputable platforms have spent years building relationships with private companies, earning their trust and streamlining this approval process.

**Legal Documentation**

The Subscription Agreement and related documents create binding legal rights to the SPV's assets. Your proportional ownership and distribution rights are clearly established. These documents are accessible through your investment account—they're not hidden or obscured.

**Regulatory Oversight**

Platforms facilitating SPV investments operate as registered broker-dealers and Investment Advisors under SEC and FINRA oversight. This regulatory framework provides investor protections and ensures transactions follow securities laws.

**Transaction Diligence**

Reputable platforms perform diligence on each transaction to make sure SPVs actually purchase and hold the shares as represented. This includes verifying transfers, maintaining custody, and ensuring all legal requirements are met.

### How SPVs Work from Start to Finish

Understanding the SPV lifecycle helps you know what to expect:

1. Formation

The SPV is established as a legal entity to purchase shares of one specific private company. Each SPV is separate—if you invest in SPVs for both Company X and Company Y, those are two distinct legal entities.

2. Fundraising

Accredited investors commit capital by purchasing membership interests in the SPV. This typically happens over a few weeks as the platform syndicates the deal.

3. Share Purchase

Once enough capital is raised, the SPV purchases shares from existing shareholders—often employees, early investors, or other parties looking for liquidity.

4. Company Approval

The private company reviews and approves the share transfer through its Right of First Refusal process. This is when the company formally acknowledges the SPV's ownership.

5. Holding Period

The SPV holds the shares on behalf of investors. This typically 1 year prior to secondary trading with a full SPV lifecycle that lasts 2-10 years until a liquidity event—an IPO, acquisition, or other exit.

6. Exit

When the company goes public, gets acquired, or another liquidity event occurs, the SPV distributes proceeds to investors based on proportional ownership.

Throughout this entire process, you maintain your proportional ownership rights. If the company undergoes corporate actions—stock splits, mergers, additional funding rounds—the SPV's holdings (and therefore your indirect ownership) adjust accordingly.

### Why SPVs Matter

The SPV structure has fundamentally changed who can access pre-IPO investing. What was once limited to venture capital firms and ultra-high-net-worth individuals is now available to accredited investors with minimums as low as $5,000-$10,000.

By efficiently pooling capital and simplifying private company cap tables, SPVs created a scalable model for bringing institutional-quality opportunities to individual investors.

For you, this means access to carefully vetted opportunities in innovative private companies with clear ownership structures and professional management. For private companies, it means access to a broader investor base without the headache of managing hundreds of individual shareholders.

The SPV structure makes pre-IPO investing work—for everyone.
