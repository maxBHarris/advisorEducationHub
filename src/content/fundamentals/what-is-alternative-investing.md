An alternative investment—also known as an "alt" or "private investment"— represent investment opportunities beyond traditional stocks, bonds, and cash. For decades, these investments were reserved for institutions and the ultra-wealthy. That's changing fast.

### What Counts as an Alternative Investment?

Alternative investments cover a wide range of asset classes that work differently from traditional public stocks and bonds. Examples include:

**Private equity:** Investments in private companies, including buyout and growth equity

**Private credit:** Loans and debt investments in private companies

**Real estate:** Direct property investments and real estate funds

**Infrastructure:** Investments in essential facilities and systems

**Hedge funds:** Pooled investment vehicles using diverse strategies

**Venture capital:** Early-stage company investments

**Pre-IPO companies:** Late-stage private companies preparing to go public

**Art and collectibles:** Tangible alternative assets

Each asset class has its own risk profile, liquidity characteristics, and potential returns. Understanding which alts fit your investment goals is the first step.

Alternative investments have become a critical piece of modern portfolios. In 2023, private market assets under management hit $13.1 trillion, up 12% from the year before. Projections show this could reach $15 trillion by 2025 and exceed $18 trillion by 2027. As companies stay private longer and investors look for better returns, alts have gone from "nice to have" to "need to have" in diversified portfolios.

### Who's Had Access (Until Now)

Historically, alternative investments were the exclusive domain of institutional investors—pension funds, endowments, university foundations—and ultra-high-net-worth individuals with direct access to investment managers. These investors enjoyed the benefits: potential for higher returns, portfolio diversification, and access to innovative companies years before they went public.

**The barriers keeping everyone else out were real:** investment minimums often ran into the millions, legal structures were complex, and information was hard to come by. For most individual investors, alts simply weren't an option.

### Why Things Are Changing

The alternative investment landscape is transforming. Three big shifts are making alts accessible to more accredited investors:

**Companies Are Staying Private Longer**

The public markets look different than they did 30 years ago. The number of public companies has dropped by 50% since then, while the number of private companies has grown by 43%.

**Here's what that means:** Over 19,000 private companies in the U.S. now generate more than $100 million in revenue. Compare that to fewer than 3,000 public companies of similar size. Twenty years ago, most of these companies would have already gone public.

The result? Some of today's most innovative companies—the ones building AI, revolutionizing healthcare, or creating new technologies—are staying private and building massive value outside the public markets. If you want exposure to these companies, you need access to private markets.

**Technology Is Lowering the Barriers**

Platforms like Monark are using technology to solve what used to be insurmountable problems. Investment minimums that were once $1 million+ are now as low as $5,000. Complex legal processes are being streamlined through digital platforms. Information that was once opaque is now transparent and accessible.

This isn't just about making things easier—it's about fundamentally changing who can participate in private markets.

**The Returns Make Sense**

Private equity investments have outperformed the S&P 500 over 5, 10, 15, and 20-year periods. The average 10-year return is 17.3%, compared to 11.9% for public markets.

Beyond raw returns, alternative investments help reduce portfolio risk. Because they have low correlation with public markets, they can provide a hedge when stocks are volatile. For investors looking to reduce exposure to the ups and downs of public equity markets, alts offer a real solution.

**Regulations Have Evolved**

Changes to accredited investor definitions and the rise of new investment structures have opened doors. What was once reserved exclusively for institutions is now accessible to accredited individuals who meet specific income or net-worth requirements.

**The bottom line:** Alternative investments are no longer just for institutions. Accredited investors can now build diversified portfolios that include exposure to private companies, private credit, real estate, and other alternative assets—all alongside their traditional public market holdings.
